# Cloud Server and Extensions
(TO ME) Running AWS Cloud server instance for Web Service

## Kinds of Cloud server
(TO ME) Iaas-oriented, Paas-oriented, Saas-oriented

[redhat : kinds of Cloud](https://www.redhat.com/ko/topics/cloud-computing/iaas-vs-paas-vs-saas)

I think this categorization is becoming more ambiguous because individual field expand

at the same time, I think Iaas-oriented, Paas-oriented, Saas-oriented are still plausible.

so i will try to use those.
