# Cloud-Utilizations
cloud like aws cloud conceptions to understand and utilize cloud

## My direction 
From SaaS, PaaS to IaaS with a little basic OS

IaaS is the most closest cloud to origin server among these. So, it can be very helpful to learn base conception of server.

but it is related with all most everything like OS like linux(or server engineering), Network of computer, DB engineering.....

I conclude that i should concentrated on 'cloud utilizations' especially with SaaS, PaaS.

cuz,I think, these consist of components selected by prior developers because of its benefits. I want to utilize their experience and conclusion to develop app.
