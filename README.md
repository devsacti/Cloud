# Cloud Server

## Kinds of Cloud server
(TO ME) Iaas-oriented, Paas-oriented, Saas-oriented

[Redhat : kinds of Cloud ; IaaS, Pass, Saas](https://www.redhat.com/ko/topics/cloud-computing/iaas-vs-paas-vs-saas)

I think above categorization is becoming more ambiguous because individaul case expands their own function and field.

But, I think, Iaas-oriented, Paas-oriented, Saas-oriented are still plausible yet.

So, I will try to use this classification.

## CSP : Cloud Service Provider
 AWS(Amazon Web Service), Oracle, Azure, GCP(Google Cloud Platform) are the CSP

 CSP provides generally virtualized resources not only Cloud Server, but also Security, Network ip, ...

 those resources are requirement of development of web-app, comercial services
 
#### Virtualized resources
(TO ME) Transformed Resources from original Physical unit to Logical unit.

server + server + server + ... = virtualized server * n ; n is flexible

[Cloud compute instance ; Iaas-oriented server]

[Database Server ; Paas-oriented server]

[? ; Saas-oriented server]

[Security]

[Networking]

[Identity and Access Management : IAM]

## Practices

#### Iaas-oriented
[Impl REST API Server with Spring MVC Project]

[Impl CI with EC2, STS and Github](https://github.com/devsacti/Cloud-Utilizations/tree/main/Impl%20CICD)

[DEVOPS](https://github.com/devsacti/Cloud-Utilizations/tree/main/DEVOPS)

#### Paas-oriented
[Oracle DB ; ATP]

[AWS RDS](https://github.com/devsacti/Cloud-Utilizations/tree/main/Database%20Service)

#### Kubernetes : AWS EKS
to be supplemented..
