# Cloud Server and Extensions

## Kinds of Cloud server
(TO ME) Iaas-oriented, Paas-oriented, Saas-oriented

[redhat : kinds of Cloud](https://www.redhat.com/ko/topics/cloud-computing/iaas-vs-paas-vs-saas)

I think this categorization is becoming more ambiguous because individaul case expands

But, I think, Iaas-oriented, Paas-oriented, Saas-oriented are still plausible yet.

So, I will try to use this classification.

## CSP : Cloud Service Provider
 AWS(Amazon Web Service), Oracle, Azure, GCP(Google Cloud Platform) are the CSP

 CSP provides generally virtualized resources like Cloud Server, Database Server, Security, Network ip, ...

 those resources are the source of development of web-app, comercial services
 
#### Virtualized resources
(TO ME) Transformed Resources from original physical unit to Logical unit.
