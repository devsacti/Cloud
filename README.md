# Cloud-Utilizations
cloud like aws, the ways to utilize cloud, conceptions to understand and utilize cloud

# From SaaS, PaaS to IaaS
IaaS is the most closest cloud to origin server among these. So, it can be very helpful to learn base conception of server. but it is related with all most everything like OS like linux(or server engineering), Network of computer, DB engineering.....

I conclude that i should concentrated on 'cloud utilizations' especially with SaaS, PaaS.

I think these consist of components selected by veteran developers because of its benefits.

I want to utilize their experience and conclusion to develop app.
