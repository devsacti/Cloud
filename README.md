# Cloud Server and Extensions

## Kinds of Cloud server
(TO ME) Iaas-oriented, Paas-oriented, Saas-oriented

[redhat : kinds of Cloud](https://www.redhat.com/ko/topics/cloud-computing/iaas-vs-paas-vs-saas)

I think this categorization is becoming more ambiguous because individual field expand

at the same time, I think Iaas-oriented, Paas-oriented, Saas-oriented are still plausible.

so i will try to use those.

## AWS : Amazon Web Services
(TO ME) As long as free, it is my default dev environment

 AWS is cloud platform that provides generally virtualized resources

like Cloud  Server, Database, Security, Network ip, ...

those resources are the source of development of web-app, comercial services
 
#### Virtualized resources
i think, virtualizing is transformation from original physical unit to Logical unit.
